🛠️ How It Works

The program takes a mathematical expression as input.

It constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the expression.

The tree is evaluated recursively to compute the final result.

▶️ Usage

Compile and run the program, then input a mathematical expression to evaluate it.

system("cls");
cout << "This program takes a string and calculates it." << endl;
