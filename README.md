Overview

This program takes a mathematical expression as a string, constructs a tree representation of the expression, and evaluates the result.

Supported Operations

The program supports the following operators:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Exponentiation (^)

Supported Functions

The program also supports common mathematical functions:

sin(x) - Sine function

cos(x) - Cosine function

tan(x) - Tangent function

cot(x) - Cotangent function

log(x) - Logarithm (base 10)

ln(x) - Natural logarithm (base e)

How It Works

The program receives a mathematical expression in string format.

It constructs a tree representation (Abstract Syntax Tree) of the expression.

The tree is evaluated recursively to compute the final result.

Usage

Compile and run the program, then input a mathematical expression to evaluate it.

system("cls");
cout << "This program takes a string and calculates it." << endl;
