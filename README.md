📌 Math Expression Evaluator

🚀 Overview

This program processes a mathematical expression as a string, builds a tree representation of the expression, and evaluates the result efficiently.

✨ Supported Operations

The program supports the following mathematical operators:

+ Addition

- Subtraction

* Multiplication

/ Division

^ Exponentiation

🎯 Supported Functions

Additionally, the program supports several mathematical functions:

sin(x): Sine function

cos(x): Cosine function

tan(x): Tangent function

cot(x): Cotangent function

log(x): Logarithm (base 10)

ln(x): Natural logarithm (base e)

🛠️ How It Works

The program takes a mathematical expression as input.

It constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the expression.

The tree is evaluated recursively to compute the final result.
